## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You might be wondering why we made Investbrain? Well, there was simply nothing else like it out there. 

We wanted a single pane of glass to track our investments, performance, holdings over time, dividends, splits, etc.  

Not to mention, we wanted a way to leverage advances in Large Language Models to "chat with our holdings" with the goal of being more informed investors.

That's why we made Investbrain. We're proud of what we've built and eager to share with the open source community!
